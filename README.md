A simple Java Hangman game that picks a random word from 100 predefined words and lets the player guess it. Alternatively the user can also add their own custom words. The custom words system is not really practical yet, since the user has to manually add the words in the "customWords.txt" file generated by the program. I want to improve the custom words feature in the future, but feel free to do so yourself if you want (please make sure to fork the repository and share you changes).
